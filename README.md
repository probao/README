Hello everyone! My name is Ben Wu, a ECUST-UCR joint PhD in computational chemistry. I have indulged in math, physics and chemistry since I was a child. My dream was to become a scientist . However after my 5-year PhD experience, I realize that `leaving chinese academia is my biggest contribution to the future of chinese academia.` It's just a joke.
